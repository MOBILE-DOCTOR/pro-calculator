IMPORTANT for my-download-app/index.html:

href for manifest and src for service worker: These paths are critical for GitHub Pages. They should be relative to your GitHub Pages base URL. Since your React app is served from https://mobile-doctor.github.io/pro-calculator/my-download-app/, the paths to manifest.json and service-worker.js (which are in the public folder and get copied to the dist root by Vite) need to be /pro-calculator/my-download-app/manifest.json and /pro-calculator/my-download-app/service-worker.js respectively.
