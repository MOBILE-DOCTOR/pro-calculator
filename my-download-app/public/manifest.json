IMPORTANT for manifest.json:

start_url: This path is relative to your GitHub Pages root. https://mobile-doctor.github.io/pro-calculator/ is your root. Your React app's index.html is inside my-download-app/dist. So, the URL to reach it is https://mobile-doctor.github.io/pro-calculator/my-download-app/. For the start_url within the manifest, it needs to be relative to the manifest itself if the manifest is in public. Vite will handle moving public content to dist. So, start_url should be /pro-calculator/my-download-app/index.html.

Icons: I've included placeholder paths for icons. You will need to create a new folder named icons inside my-download-app/public/ and place actual icon-192x192.png and icon-512x512.png files there. You can use any generic icons for now. If you don't have them, the PWA might still install, but without an icon.

Example placeholder images you could use:

icon-192x192.png: https://placehold.co/192x192/007bff/ffffff?text=App

icon-512x512.png: https://placehold.co/512x512/007bff/ffffff?text=App
